This file marks a valid travail installation.

The travail CLI resolves paths relative to its parent directory (bin/../).
If this file is missing, travail will refuse to run to prevent accidental
operations on unintended directories.

Do not copy the bin/travail script to another location without the full
repository structure, as it may cause data loss (e.g., feature removal
targeting wrong directories).
